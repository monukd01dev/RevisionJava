Lets talk more about classes and objects

1. What is class?
    Class is a collection of similar type of Objects
    -> In our previous example I have said that you and I are objects of class Human so, we have some similarities too, we both have 2 hands, 2 legs and 1 head etc.
    -> In same way think about our second example about planets.

2. Objects
    a. Read the previous one
    b. Now all the technical terms starts from here
    c. objects have some
        I.  properties/state    (Instance Variables/DataMembers)
        II. behaviours          (Methods / MemberFunctions)

    d. DataMembers and MemberFunctions both have 2 types(These types are created according scope of (accessibility))
        I.  Non-Static
            1. Belongs to Objects
                -> as it belongs to object, and we know that there is no limits to the no of objects in a class and not every object have same value for their properties
                -> the value of these variables are different for each object
                -> these variable are often called instance variable as it's belongs to instances(object/reference id)
                -> we can use these variable and methods by objects only, cause it belongs to object
                -> to access any non-static data-member and member function you need object(reference id).
                -> objects are runtime entity that's why non-static things get memory at runtime
        II. Static
            1. Belongs To Class
                -> for n number of similar objects we have one class so, anything which belongs to class is same for every object.
                -> value of static variable and definition of static method is same of every object of that class
                -> static things can be access through class name and also without class name if it is inside the class block
                -> static things get memory at compile time if your template isn't ready at compile time how you'll create instances at run-time
