What is This keyword and why we need it?

1. what is this keyword:
    a. reference variable
    b. hold the reference id of current object (calling object)
    c. by default it has the reference id of current object(calling object)

2. why we need it :
    a. this keyword is introduce to overcome the problem of Data Shadowing.
        I.  Data Shadowing : when your data-member name and member-function parameter name(local variable) is same and technology have failed to pick the desired variable that condition is known as data shadowing.
        II. Which variable is selected is very clear, member-functions variable is selected because priority goes to local variable.

3. how it works :
    a. when your call any member-function your object through which you call the member-function became the calling object and its reference is stored inside this keyword.
    b. After you have the reference id you make things more specific and tell the technology which one to pick.
    c. And data shadowing is gone now.

4. uses of this keyword :
    a. this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
    b. this only works with non-static context
        I.  this is used to invoke current class method from another method(non-static), if don't put this technology implicitly put this keyword.
        II. whenever we have to refer instance variable we use this keyword.
    c. this() to invoke current class constructor (Constructor chaining).
            -> call to this() must be the first statement in constructor.
    d. this is used to pass as an argument in the method call.
            -> for example in eventHandling like addActionListener(this)...
    e. this can be passed as argument in the constructor call.
    f. this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.
