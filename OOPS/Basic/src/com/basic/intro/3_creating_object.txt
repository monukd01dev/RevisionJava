How to create Object of a Class

For this is in Java we have an Operator(Symbols that tells what operation have to perform) and Keyword(Reserved word which have different meaning) which is new.

new -> operator/keyword

what's new do :
-> allocate a memory buffer during runtime in heap
-> that buffer have an id/reference for its recognition
-> new returns the reference id.

Example : Assume that I have a class Planet and I have to create an Object for the Planet class...
    Syntax :    Class_name reference_variable = new Class_name();
    actual :    Planet     earth              = new Planet();


Now know about earth :
-> Class type variable
-> reference variable
-> non-primitive variable
