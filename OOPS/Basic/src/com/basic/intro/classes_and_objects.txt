Lets talk more about classes and objects

1. What is class?
    Class is a collection of similar type of Objects
    -> In our previous example I have said that you and I are objects of class Human so, we have some similarities too we both have 2 hands, 2 legs and 1 head etc.
    -> In same way think about our second example about planets.

2. Objects
    a. Read the previous one
    b. Now all the technical terms starts from here
    c. objects have some
        I.  properties/state    (Instance Variables/DataMembers)
        II. behaviours          (Methods / MemberFunctions)

    d. DataMembers and MemberFunctions both have 2 types(These types are created according scope of (accessibility))
        I.  Non-Static
            1. Belongs to Objects
                -> as it belongs to object, and we know that there is no limits to the no of objects in a class and not every object have same value for their properties
                -> the value of these variables are different for each object
                ->
        II. Static
            1. Belongs To Class
            2. it is same for every object
