To acquire the fields and method of another class into our class, we have two ways in Java to do so
1. Inheritance (IS-A)
2. Association (Entity Reference)
    a. Aggregation (Has-A)
    b. Composition (Part-Of)

Aggregation (Has-A)
    -> If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation.
    -> Aggregation represents Has-A relationship.

//What to do
//code the examples
// understand difference between inheritance and association?
// inheritance is a parent child relationship between two classes?
// whereas association is an relationship established through objects reference?
